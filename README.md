# Emacs Configuration

This is the configuration I use.


## Tips

These are some tips I've found useful. I write them down so I can remember them.


Find a replace on certain files:

```
    - M-x find-name-dired: you will be prompted for a root directory and a filename pattern.
    - Press t to "toggle mark" for all files found.
    - Press Q for "Query-Replace in Files...": you will be prompted for query/substitution regexps.
    - Proceed as with query-replace-regexp: SPACE to replace and move to next match, n to skip a match, etc.
```
